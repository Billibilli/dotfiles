zool's dotfiles
==============

Personal configuration files.  I mostly use a combination of bash, vim and git in my daily work.

My main machine is a modified Thinkpad x100e running [Crunchbang](http://crunchbang.org/), a nimble and infinitely hackable Debian-based Linux distro. It's fast.

This repo includes dotfiles for:

- bash
- git
- vimrc
- openbox
- terminator
- compton
- conky
- mr
- mutt
- tint2
- xmodmap
- xxkb

The bash script for symlinking is buggy and unmaintained, run it at your own risk.
