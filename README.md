zool's dotfiles for Linux
=========================

Config files for Linux.

My main machine is a tweaked Thinkpad x100e running [Crunchbang](http://crunchbang.org/), a nimble and infinitely hackable Debian-based Linux distro. It's fast. 

This is how it looks:

Tools of the trade
------------------

This repo includes dotfiles for:

- bash
- git
- vim
- ack
- mr
- mutt

Specifically for #!:
- openbox
- terminator
- compton
- conky
- tint2
- xmodmap
- xxkb


Notes
-----

The bash script for symlinking is buggy and unmaintained, run it at your own risk.
