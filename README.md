zool's dotfiles
===============

Config files for my \*nix systems.

My main machine is a tweaked Thinkpad x100e running [Crunchbang](http://crunchbang.org/), a nimble, Debian-based Linux distro.

I work a lot on Macs as well. Settings for Linux and Mac OS X get loaded conditionally in the `bashrc`. It's a bit messy but still better than maintaining two separate config repos :)
